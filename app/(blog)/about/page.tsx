            <p className="mb-4 text-sm text-gray-500">Dear Reader,</p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-sm text-gray-500">
              My name is Zahida Raees, and I am an IT professional and a passionate literary author. Research and writing are among my greatest joys, and I am particularly fascinated by learning about the world&apos;s most famous cities.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-sm text-gray-500">
              I created this blog for people like meâ€”those who have a love for travel and a curiosity about cities they plan to visit. Through this platform, I hope to provide valuable insights that can help you explore and understand these destinations even before setting foot there.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-sm text-gray-500">
              If you would like to learn more about yourself, your favorite city, or if you have information you&apos;d like to share, feel free to reach out. I would be delighted to feature your contributions here.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-sm text-gray-500">Thank you so much for visiting the blog!</p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-sm text-gray-500">Warm regards,</p>
